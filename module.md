### Algebric Parser
Simple OOP C++ implementation of an algebraic expression parser
- Supports: numbers (int/float), identifiers (variables), binary operators + - * /,
- unary + and -, parentheses

Future impls (if I think to implement):
- pow 
- functional calls

so here I have to first start with writing tokens.
